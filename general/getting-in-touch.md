# Getting in touch

cellfinder is still at a very early stage, so we know that there will be bugs, and features that you might want that we haven't added yet.

There are two main sources of help. These are both public, because if you have an issue, there's likely plenty more people who come across the same problem.

## General guidance \(gitter\)

If you want general help with cellfinder, best practices etc, an error message you don't understand, please use the [gitter](https://gitter.im/cellfinder/) chat rooms. There are different rooms for different types of conversation \(e.g. installation, cell detection etc\).

## Bugs and feature requests
