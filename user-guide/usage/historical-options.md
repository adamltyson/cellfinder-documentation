# Historical options

_If you are a new cellfinder user, it is unlikely you want to use these options. They are intended for those migrating from earlier versions of the software_

**If you have channel numbers that you'd like to carry over into cellfinder**

* `--signal-channel-ids`. Channel ID numbers, in the same order as 'signal-planes-paths. Will default to '0, 1, 2' etc, but maybe useful to specify.
* `--background-channel-id` Channel ID number, corresponding to 'background-planes-path'
